## Line comparision
The project is about comparing two line lengths based on Cartesian System with user given inputs.

## Languages
Using java based on oops concepts.

## Formula for calculating line length
```
length=sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2)
```
1. As the formula specifies (x1,x2),(y1,y2) are two end points.
2. Performed git operations to move from local to remote.
